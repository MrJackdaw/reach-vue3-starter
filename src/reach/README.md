# Reach Helpers

## What is it?
A folder with some basic helpers and a global pub-sub Reach state manager.

## How do I use it?
This section contains a few individual components that can be imported and used independently. Look in the folder code to see what's available. 

### `ReachStore` Instance methods
  * `getState()`:\
    Returns an object containing all state properties. Can be deconstructed for individual items.

  * `subscribe(args)`:
    ```typescript
    subscribe(
      listener: (updates: Record<string, any>, updatedKeys: string[])
    ): unsubscribeFn:() => void
    ```
    Use `subscribe` to subscribe all changes to the `ReachStore` instance. As in Redux, you supply a `listener` function that is triggered when any state property is updated. The listener receives two arguments: the updated state, and a list of state properties that were updated.

  A lightweight redux-like global state manager. You can create additional instances (e.g. to separate global UI state values from Reach values), or build out the `ReachStore` instance (by adding properties to it) if you want to use that as your single application state. View the [library API](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@jackcom/raphsducks#reference) to learn how to use it.
